<h3>Steps</h3>
        <h4>Pre-cook and shred the meat</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Trim the meat, if necessary, and cut it into 4 pieces. Place the pieces in a medium soup pot and cover them with water. Add 1 quartered onion and simmer for 2 hours, removing any foam that may float to the top.</li>
                <li>Once cooked, remove the beef from the water and let it cool slightly. (Reserve 2 c of the cooking broth).</li>
                <li>Once cool enough to handle, shred the meat with two forks. Set aside.</li>
            </ol>
        <h4>Make sauce and season meat</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Once cool enough to handle, shred the meat with two forks. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Once cool enough to handle, shred the meat with two forks. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Add the shredded meat and 2 c of the meat broth. Bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered, for 20 min. (If you are serving your carne mechada with rice and beans, classic Venezuelan style, go ahead a leave the meat a little brothy. If you will be using it to fill arepas or empanadas, you will want to cook it until nearly dry, stirring often so it doesn’t stick.)</li>
