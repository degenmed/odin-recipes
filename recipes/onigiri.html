<h3>Description</h3>
    <p>It is literally cooked rice shaped into a triangle (sometimes cylinder or sphere).</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>600g Cooked Short Grain Japanese White Rice (hot)</li>
        <li>2g Salt</li>
        <li>Nori (Seaweed)</li>
        <li>A bowl of iced or cold water</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>First, cook your rice. Use short grain white rice, preferably Japanese sushi rice or something similar. You need the rice to be sticky so that it holds it shape.</li>
        <li>Have your set up ready. You should have your cooked rice, a bowl of water and ice and a small bowl of salt. Nori is optional too.</li>
        <li>Wash your hands well and then submerge them into the bowl of icy cold water for about 15-20 seconds. This stops the rice sticking to your hands.</li>
        <li>Rub 1-2 pinches of salt over the palms your hands. This not only adds the flavour to the rice ball, but also acts as a preservative whilst it's in your lunchbox.</li>
        <li>Take a handful of warm cooked rice and start to press it together, pressing the edges to form a triangle shape. If you press and turn, press and turn, press and turn, you should make a good firm triangle shape.</li>
        <li>Don't handle the rice for too long, quicker is better. Once you're happy with the shape, wrap it with nori.</li>
        <li>Put your hands back in the icy water and repeat. This recipe makes 5-6 rice balls (depending on size).</li>
        <li>Eat straight away or put in your lunch box with an ice pack. They're best eaten the same day.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
